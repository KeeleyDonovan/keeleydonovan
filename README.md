### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with experience in distributed systems, infrastructure, and privacy preservation techniques.

I love short walks on the beach, Architectural Digest, and nonfiction.

My open source projects are hosted on my GitHub profile.

Currently, I'm a PhD candidate in the Human Dynamics Group at the MIT Media Lab and an engineer at Rebellion Defense. If you're still curious about me, take a look at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keeleyerhardt/). If you need to contact me, email keeley@mit.edu.
